_In a nutshell: please be respectful and use common sense._

## Hacking

* Hacking Pathwar is cool. Patching it right after is super cool.
* Don’t go overboard with the hacking. Same joke repeated twice isn’t as funny.
* If you’re a student and use Pathwar as a part of your school project, make sure you comply with the rules of your school.

## Interacting with other users

Yes, you’re competing with other players, and can steal their coins and hack their account.
But it’s important to keep things civil. Do not insult or put down other participants.
Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.
Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
* Discriminatory jokes and language.
* Public or private harassment.
* Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
* Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information.
* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
